# fk-beamforming-merapi
This was my first Python project when I was working on my college final project. Yes, it's messy, and I'm still learning. Using frequency wavenumber beamforming (fk-beamforming) calculations based on seismic data from four stations, I calculated the back azimuth of rockfall and pyroclastic flow in Merapi Mountain, Yogyakarta. Cheers!
